Provides compilers for use with Bit.

compilers/nextjs
- Extremely bare bones compiler for nextjs component support with bit. Plenty of room for improvement. Feel free to contribute.
    - consider using peer dependencies for react and nextjs packages to allow for more version flexibility. 
- Copies code from bit.envs babel compilers due to an issue loading the nextjs/babel preset.
